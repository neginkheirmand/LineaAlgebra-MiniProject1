# System of Linear Equations   

**Implementation of Row Reduction Algorithm**

### Reference

> "STEP 1
Begin with the leftmost nonzero column. This is a pivot column. The pivot
position is at the top."

> "STEP 2
Select a nonzero entry in the pivot column as a pivot. If necessary, interchange
rows to move this entry into the pivot position."

> "STEP 3
Use row replacement operations to create zeros in all positions below the pivot."

> "STEP 4
Cover (or ignore) the row containing the pivot position and cover all rows, if any,
above it. Apply steps 1â€“3 to the submatrix that remains. Repeat the process until
there are no more nonzero rows to modify."

> "STEP 5
Beginning with the rightmost pivot and working upward and to the left, create
zeros above each pivot. If a pivot is not 1, make it 1 by a scaling operation."
